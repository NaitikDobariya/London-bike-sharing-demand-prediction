## LSTM Bicycle Demand Predictor

Welcome to the LSTM Bicycle Demand Predictor project! This project focuses on developing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model capable of predicting the demand for bicycles in the city of London. Through extensive data analysis, feature engineering, and model training, this project aims to provide valuable insights into bicycle demand patterns in urban environments.

### About the Project

This project represents a comprehensive effort to forecast bicycle demand in London using LSTM neural networks. Key project components include:

- **Data Visualization**: Exploring and visualizing the dataset to gain insights into bicycle demand trends over time.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Conducting thorough analysis to identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies within the dataset.
- **Feature Creation**: Engineering new features from existing data to enhance the predictive power of the model.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Preparing the dataset for model training by scaling features and handling missing values.
- **Model Training**: Developing multiple versions of LSTM models and optimizing them to achieve the best performance.
